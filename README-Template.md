# Using function in python

The objective of this data loading assignment is to use functions to make codes compact and easiy to reference and to load data into new tables. The assignment also covers conducting distribution analysis on data using python. 

## Approach

The approach is as follows: 
1. Filter first 1000 rows of the datasource “youtube_dataset.csv” which contains 4000 rows. 
2. Create a function that calculates the distribution of “channeltype” 
3. Call the function to view results. 


### Prerequisites

Install Anaconda and Jupiter notebook



## Deployment

 Libraries are imported for plotting graphs 
Datasource is read and loaded to dataframe df 
Datasource is sorted in descending order to capture top 1000 channeltypes based on subscribers and assigned to a new df “sorted_df” 
First 1000 rows are filtered and assigned to a new dataframe “filtered_df” 
Tail of new dataframe shows that first 1000 rows have been filtered 
Function is created to calculate distribution of records in channel type from the top 1000 records. 
Function is called to display the output of the function. 
Function is created to plot the distribution of records in channel type from the top 1000 records. 
Function is called to display the output of the function.
